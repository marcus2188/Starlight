# Starlight

### *Why aim for the moon when you can go to the stars?*

Space is bountiful in its ever expanding presence. We view it through the lens of the constellations of the night sky, segmented regions of observable space with reference to Earth. Its been one of the most fascinating fields of study even to this day, where the names of star signs are worshipped and lauded by academics and keen citizens alike. While we often dabble with these mysterious star signs, not many know of their origins or true meanings. 

Zodiac star signs; the most famous variety of the bunch, is only one of the 8 families of constellations in the vast night sky. This web app aims to educate users on the origins of these names that we come to love. The universe is way bigger than just Leo, Virgo or Aries. There is just more to see. Some more obscure: Canis Major, Perseus..., others familiar: (Hail!) Hydra, Andromeda (galaxy)...

I will make Starlight using the latest and arguably the best framework for web programming to date: Angular 11 by Google and TypeScript by Microsoft. It also aims to utilise its noble features: Strict MVC architecture, Dependency Injection (DI), Routing Protocol, Angular Material and more.
